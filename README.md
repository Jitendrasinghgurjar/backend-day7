# 😄 Mood Player – Real-Time Emotion-Based Music App

Ever imagined your computer understanding your mood — just by looking at your face — and playing music accordingly?

That’s what I built with *React* and *face-api.js*!

---

## 🎯 What It Does

- Opens your *webcam* in the browser  
- Detects your *current facial expression* (happy, sad, surprised, etc.)  
- Based on your mood, it recommends music (or sets the vibe)  
- Runs completely in the browser — *no backend, no server*  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- *React.js* for the UI  
- *face-api.js* for face detection & emotion recognition  
- *Web APIs* for webcam access  
- *CSS Modules* for scoped styling

## 💡 What I Learned

This project really stretched my skills — from working with browser media APIs to integrating ML models in the frontend. I learned how to:

- Use webcam feed in React apps  
- Load and run face-api.js models in real-time  
- Draw face boundaries + emotion labels on canvas  
- Map expressions to actions (like songs or UI feedback)

## ❤ A Note from Me

This wasn’t just a project — it was an *experience*.

I never thought working with ML in frontend could be this fun. From handling video streams to seeing my app react to a smile… it felt like magic.

Thanks to (@sheryians coding school) for pushing us to build things that feel *futuristic* yet doable.

This is just one project in my full-stack dev journey, but it’s one I’ll always remember.
